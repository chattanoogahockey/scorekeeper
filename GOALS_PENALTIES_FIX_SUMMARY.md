# Goals and Penalties API Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The goals and penalties APIs were not working because of **field mapping mismatches** between the frontend and backend, and **inconsistent URL construction patterns** compared to the working attendance API.

## Root Causes
1. **Field Mapping Issues**: Frontend was sending different field names than what the backend expected
2. **URL Construction Inconsistency**: Goals and penalties weren't using the same environment-aware URL pattern as attendance
3. **Response Structure Mismatch**: Backend response didn't match what the test expected

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Frontend Field Mapping in Dashboard.jsx

**Goals API Fixes:**
- Changed `scoringTeam` → `team` (backend expects 'team')
- Changed `scorer` → `player` (backend expects 'player') 
- Changed `assists` array → `assist` single field (backend expects single assist)
- Added environment-aware URL construction like attendance API

**Penalties API Fixes:**
- Changed `penalizedPlayer` → `player` (backend expects 'player')
- Changed `length` → `penaltyLength` (backend expects 'penaltyLength')
- Added environment-aware URL construction like attendance API

### 2. Updated Backend Response Structure

**Goals API:**
- Changed from returning raw resource to structured response: `{ success: true, goal: resource }`
- This matches the test expectations and provides consistent API responses

### 3. Ensured Consistent API Patterns

All APIs now follow the same pattern:
```javascript
const apiUrl = import.meta.env.DEV 
  ? '/api/[endpoint]' 
  : `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL}/api/[endpoint]`;
```

## Field Mapping Reference

### Goals API
| Frontend Field | Backend Field | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|-------|
| `scoringTeam` | `team` | Team that scored |
| `scorer` | `player` | Player who scored |
| `assist1` | `assist` | Single assist field (not array) |
| `period` | `period` | Game period |
| `time` | `time` | Time in period |
| `shotType` | `shotType` | Type of shot |
| `goalType` | `goalType` | Type of goal |

### Penalties API
| Frontend Field | Backend Field | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|-------|
| `team` | `team` | Penalized team |
| `penalizedPlayer` | `player` | Penalized player |
| `length` | `penaltyLength` | Penalty duration |
| `penaltyType` | `penaltyType` | Type of penalty |
| `period` | `period` | Game period |
| `time` | `time` | Time in period |

## Testing Results

✅ **Goals API**: Successfully creating goals with proper field mapping
✅ **Penalties API**: Successfully creating penalties with proper field mapping  
✅ **Attendance API**: Already working correctly
✅ **Frontend-Backend Integration**: All tests passing
✅ **Environment Switching**: Works in both development (proxy) and production modes

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Fixed field mapping and URL construction
2. `backend/server.js` - Updated goals API response structure
3. Created comprehensive test files to verify functionality

## Verification

All APIs tested and working:
- Backend integration test: PASSED
- Frontend connection test: PASSED
- Individual API tests: PASSED
- Complete workflow test: PASSED

The goals and penalties data is now successfully being sent to the backend and stored in the Cosmos DB containers.
