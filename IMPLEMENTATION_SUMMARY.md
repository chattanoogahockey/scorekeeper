}
```

#### Female Announcer (👩)

  style: "Balances snark with positivity, adds trivia",
  voiceSettings: { rate: 1.0, pitch: 1.1 }
}
```

### 🎵 Audio Playback System

#### Dual Announcer Playback (`playDualAnnouncement()`)
- Sequential TTS with voice switching
- Male voice: Lower pitch, slower rate
- Female voice: Higher pitch, normal rate  
- 500ms pause between speakers
- Progress tracking for full conversation
- Wake lock during long announcements
- Graceful error handling

#### Voice Selection Logic
```javascript
// Male voices: Daniel, David, Alex (if available)
// Female voices: Samantha, Karen, Moira (if available)
// Fallback to browser defaults
```

### 🔧 Backend Architecture

#### New Functions in `announcerService.js`
- `generateDualGoalAnnouncement()`: GPT-4 powered goal conversations
- `generateDualPenaltyAnnouncement()`: GPT-4 powered penalty conversations  
- `generateDualRandomCommentary()`: Advanced seeded + freeform AI dialogue

#### Enhanced Server Endpoints
- All endpoints check for dual mode support
- Proper error handling for missing AI services
- No TTS processing for dual mode (handled in frontend)
- Maintains backward compatibility with single announcer mode

### 📱 User Experience

#### Mode Switching
- Instant mode switching with visual feedback
- Settings persist across browser sessions
- Clear button labeling and tooltips

#### Audio Progress
- Real-time progress bar during conversations
- Speaker identification during playback  
- Visual indication of male vs female speaker

#### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when AI services unavailable
- Clear error messages for users
- Maintains functionality even without OpenAI API

## 🎯 Technical Specifications
