# Hockey Scorekeeper 2.1

A modern, mobile-first hockey scorekeeper application built with React and Node.js, featuring real-time goal tracking, roster management, and Azure Cosmos DB integration. Designed by scorekeepers, for scorekeepers.

This repository contains a full-stack web application for real‑time hockey scorekeeping, specifically optimized for mobile and tablet use during live games. The project features a React frontend with TailwindCSS for responsive styling and an Express backend API that integrates with Azure Cosmos DB for real-time data persistence.

## 🏒 Features

### ✅ Currently Implemented
- **League & Game Management**: Browse games by league (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
- **Mobile-Optimized Interface**: Designed specifically for tablets and mobile devices used by scorekeepers
- **Team Roster Management**: Complete player rosters with numbers and positions
- **Attendance Tracking**: Record which players are present for each game, stored in Cosmos DB
- **Advanced Goal Recording System**:
  - **Calculator-Style Time Input**: Intuitive number pad for quick MM:SS time entry (validates 00:01 to 20:00)
  - **Complete Goal Details**: Scorer, assist, shot type (wrist, slap, snap, backhand), goal type (regular, power play, short-handed, penalty shot, empty net)
  - **Real-Time Database Integration**: Goals instantly saved to Cosmos DB with automatic score calculation
  - **Smart Form Validation**: Record button only activates when all required fields are completed
  - **Automatic Goal Descriptions**: System generates contextual descriptions ("First goal of the game", "Go-ahead goal", etc.)
- **Responsive Mobile Design**: 20% smaller team selection buttons, touch-friendly controls throughout
- **Real-Time Data Persistence**: All events stored in Azure Cosmos DB with immediate confirmation

## 📊 Version Management

### Historical Player Stats Import

Two methods:

1. API route (server running):
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   npm run import-historical -- "C:\\Users\\marce\\OneDrive\\Documents\\CHAHKY\\data\\final_historical_data.csv"
   ```
   Add `--dry` to preview without writes.

2. Direct Cosmos (no server needed):
   ```powershell
   npm run import-historical-direct -- "C:\\Users\\marce\\OneDrive\\Documents\\CHAHKY\\data\\final_historical_data.csv"
   ```
   Also supports `--dry`.

Required CSV columns: Name,Division,Year,Goals,Assists,PIM,GP (optional Points,League,Season). Points auto-calculated if missing.

Verify sample after import:
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/player-stats?scope=historical" | Select-Object -First 5 | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 4
```

The application uses unified versioning across all components:

- **Package Version**: Defined in root `package.json` (currently 2.1.0)
- **API Version**: Dynamically read from `backend/package.json`
- **Frontend Version**: Generated at build time from root `package.json`
- **Git Integration**: Commit hash and branch included in version info
- **Deployment Tracking**: Build timestamp from GitHub Actions

Version information is available at:
- `/api/version` (API endpoint)
- `/version.json` (static frontend file)
- Admin panel version display
