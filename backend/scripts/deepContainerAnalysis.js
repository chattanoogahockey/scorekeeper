console.log('🚨 NAMING CONFLICT IDENTIFIED:');
console.log('   Current: "players" container stores STATISTICS');
console.log('   Current: "rosters" container stores TEAM COMPOSITIONS');
console.log('   Problem: "players" suggests individual people, not their stats');
console.log('   Solution: Rename "players" → "player-stats"');
console.log('');

console.log('✅ LOGICAL CONSISTENCY CHECK:');
console.log('   - Event containers (goals, penalties, shots, ot-shootout): ✅ Clear');
console.log('   - Aggregation containers (player-stats, historical-player-stats): ✅ Clear');
console.log('   - Reference containers (rosters, games): ✅ Clear');
console.log('   - Operational containers (attendance, settings, rink-reports): ✅ Clear');
console.log('');

console.log('🔄 PROPOSED RENAMING:');
console.log('   "players" → "player-stats"');
console.log('   Benefits:');
console.log('   - Matches "historical-player-stats" naming pattern');
console.log('   - Clarifies that it contains statistics, not roster info');
console.log('   - Eliminates confusion with rosters');
console.log('   - More descriptive and professional');
